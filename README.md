configuration to open and close the contacts on the relais board to steer timebased


start first with 

sudo apt install vim


sudo apt install python3-pip

pip3 install influxdb

sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio python3-rpi.gpio

pip install schedule

pip install requests






because there is actuely no cable between the Relaisboard and the Pump in place i need to steer a SHELLY1 (r = requests.get("http://[user]:[password]@192.168.97.254/relay/0?turn=on"))

:-) hopefully i can change this in a few weeks....
